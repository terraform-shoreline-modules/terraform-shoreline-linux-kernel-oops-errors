### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Kernel Oops Errors.

Kernel Oops Errors are system crashes that occur when the Linux kernel detects an unexpected situation or behavior in the system. These errors can occur for a variety of reasons, including hardware failures, software bugs, or issues with system configuration. When a kernel oops occurs, it can cause system instability, data loss, and other issues, making it critical for software engineers to quickly diagnose and resolve the underlying cause of the error.

### Parameters

```shell
export DRIVE="PLACEHOLDER"
export STABILITY_TEST_TIMEOUT="PLACEHOLDER"
export MAX_TEMPERATURE="PLACEHOLDER"
export NUM_CPU_CORES="PLACEHOLDER"
export VERSION_NUMBER="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check for any recent kernel panic messages

```shell
dmesg | grep -i "kernel panic"
```

### Check if kernel is tainted

```shell
dmesg | grep -i "tainted"
```

### Check the system logs for any related errors

```shell
grep -i "Oops\|kernel panic" /var/log/messages
```

### Check for any hardware errors

```shell
sudo smartctl -a /dev/${DRIVE}
```

### Check for any recent Oops messages

```shell
dmesg | grep -i "Oops"
```

### Check the status of loaded kernel modules

```shell
lsmod
```

### Check system resource usage

```shell
top
```

### Overclocking: Overclocking the CPU or other components can cause instability in the system, leading to Kernel Oops errors.

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Check if CPU frequency scaling is enabled
if [[ "$(cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor | uniq)" != "userspace" ]]; then
    echo "Error: CPU frequency scaling is not set to 'userspace'. Overclocking may cause instability and Kernel Oops errors."
fi

# Check if CPU temperature is within safe limits
if [[ "$(cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone*/temp | awk '{ sum += $1; n++ } END { if (n > 0) print sum / n; }')" -gt "${MAX_TEMPERATURE}" ]]; then
    echo "Error: CPU temperature is too high. Overclocking may cause instability and Kernel Oops errors."
fi

# Check if system stability test passes
if ! stress-ng --cpu "${NUM_CPU_CORES}" --timeout "${STABILITY_TEST_TIMEOUT}" --metrics-brief | grep -q 'cpu: [0-9]*\.[0-9]*'; then
    echo "Error: System stability test failed. Overclocking may cause instability and Kernel Oops errors."
fi
```

## Repair

### Upgrade or patch the kernel to the latest version. This can help address any known bugs or issues that were fixed in the newer version.

```shell
bash
#!/bin/bash

# Step 1: Download the latest kernel version
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install linux-image-${VERSION_NUMBER}-generic

# Step 2: Reboot the system to apply the updates
sudo reboot
```
